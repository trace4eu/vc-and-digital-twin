what about the user_pin set by user while calling offer endpoint in issuer? nothign is donw with it inside offer endpoint, so why bother?
optimize memory storage to redis for offerMap and authcodeMap etc. (no prio)

one credenital configuration based on official ebsi data model: https://hub.ebsi.eu/vc-framework/data-models/inventory --> this is the data model for educational credentials: https://api-pilot.ebsi.eu/trusted-schemas-registry/v2/schemas/zEmFZquJtANNz7XNE46thRi1E2cAfpQiXVLSBdDgLyfGP
issue one login or resume credential and generalize the code to work with any credenital subject --> generalize code so that use cases can use this issuer service to include their own vc schemas that are automatically display though issuer metadata endpoint (vc schemas schould be added in folder "vc-schemas")
code refactoring so that issuer and verifier service have same folder structure: make endpoints into dto (follow style of verifier nest.js service done by pablo)
issue vcs with this function: https://github.com/trace4eu/ebsi-services-wrapper/blob/main/signature-wrapper/README.md#signvc
